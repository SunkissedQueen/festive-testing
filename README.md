# Festive Testing App  

The purpose of this React Single Page Application (SPA) is to deliver an engaging experience with a dynamic joke randomizer and a delicious Dutch baby recipe. This refreshing break filled with laughter demonstrates React's ability to present detailed and interactive content. To ensure reliability and functionality, I've enlisted the help of the enclosed React Testing Library (RTL). This superhero sidekick ensures this web application work as intended. Whether you're clicking for a new joke or exploring a mouth-watering recipe, the React Testing Library is behind the scenes, making sure the app responds correctly and that the joke randomizer and recipe components shine without hiccups!
